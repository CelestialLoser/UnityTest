# UnityTest

For the plane exercise I did a minor tweak to the camera... I just thought it would look a bit more interesting.

The technical assesment.pdf contains the theorical answers to the test. the C++.rar file, contains the source code for the C/C++ excersises.

sadly I couldn't finish exercise 3b. And exercises 7a. And 7b. 

:(
